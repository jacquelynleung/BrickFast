## How it works
#### The game starts by creating or joining an existing session, next the participants agrees on a specific number of ingredients for which the game will use.  Next the specific number of ingredients will be generated, and a countdown timer will start once the team is ready.  After the time limit, each participant will present their food creation, and then vote for which participant had the best creation.  Once voting is complete, the winner will be displayed and the game will be over.
